Trump for Incitement of Insurrection\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted today to impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. \\n\\nThis is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R.

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.   \n",

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.   \n",

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n&gt; A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n&gt; This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n&gt; When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n&gt; It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n&gt; Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n&gt; The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n&gt; Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n&gt; The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n&gt; It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n&gt; That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n&gt; About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n&gt; There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n&gt; The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n&gt; Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n&gt; The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n&gt; There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n&gt; For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.</td>\n",

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.   \n",

                                       Megathread: President Donald Trump Commutes Roger Stone's Sentence\\nOn Friday evening, President Donald Trump commuted Roger Stone's jail sentence. Stone was arrested in 2019 during the Mueller investigation, found guilty of making false statements and obstructing an investigation, and sentenced to 40 months in prison. Earlier on Friday, Stone's attempt to appeal the sentence was dismissed by the District of Colombia Circuit Court of Appeals.\\n\\nPresident Trump had tweeted about Stone's sentence numerous times in recent weeks. Last week, he tweeted that Stone was \"a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt, one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history. He can sleep well at night!\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Donald Trump commutes prison sentence of long-time adviser Roger Stone](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-11/donald-trump-commutes-long-time-adviser-roger-stone-sentence/12445732) | abc.net.au\\n[Trump Commutes Sentence of Roger Stone in Case He Long Denounced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) | nytimes.com\\n[Trump commutes ex-adviser Roger Stone's sentence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53371756) | bbc.com\\n[Trump commutes Roger Stone's prison sentence after he was convicted of covering up for the president](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-commutes-roger-stone-s-prison-sentence-after-he-was-n1138981) | nbcnews.com\\n[Trump commutes sentence of confidant Roger Stone.

primaries.\\n\\n\"Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump,\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \"Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump ‚Äì because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult.\"\\n\\nFollowing his campaign departure, Bloomberg endorsed rival and former Vice President Joe Biden. \"I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,\" he said in the statement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION |

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n&gt; A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n&gt; This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n&gt; When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n&gt; It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n&gt; Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n&gt; The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n&gt; Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n&gt; The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n&gt; It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n&gt; That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n&gt; About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n&gt; There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n&gt; The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n&gt; Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n&gt; The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n&gt; There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n&gt; For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.</td>\n",

Stone was arrested in 2019 during the Mueller investigation, found guilty of making false statements and obstructing an investigation, and sentenced to 40 months in prison. Earlier on Friday, Stone's attempt to appeal the sentence was dismissed by the District of Colombia Circuit Court of Appeals.\\n\\nPresident Trump had tweeted about Stone's sentence numerous times in recent weeks. Last week, he tweeted that Stone was \"a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt, one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history.

Or at least break Republican dominance over Texas both at the state and federal level\\nWhether Democrats or Republicans won Texas, the state has remained one of the most culturally Conservative and economically Conservative states in American history \\n\\nRepublicans have dominated Texas ever since 1952, when Eisenhower won it twice in a row, even when it was considered a part of the solid South (the old Confederate states that voted Democrat). Since 1952, Texas has only voted for a Democrat four times: JFK 1960, LBJ 1964, Hubert Humphrey 1968, Jimmy Carter 1976. \\n\\nNo Democrat has represented Texas in the Senate since 1994 (Bob Krueger). \\n\\nFor so many decades, Texas has remained the crown jewel for Republicans. It is the California for the GOP. \\n\\nBut with a huge increase in Latin American immigration, Democratic immigration (from states like California and NY etc.), and a growing hostility towards social and economic Conservatism (both neoconservatism, paleoconservatism etc.), Texas has slowly become more liberal and it's now being contested as a swing state. \\n\\nEven a lot of native Texans are beginning to dislike the Republican party. Surburban voters are becoming more liberal and the cities in Texas are reliably Democratic strongholds (Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas) \\n\\nIn the House, 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats reprsent Texas \\n\\nRepublicans still control both the House and Senate in the Texas legislature \\n\\nSenate: \\n\\n\\\\-19 Republicans \\n\\n\\\\-12 Democrats \\n\\nHouse: \\n\\n\\\\-83 Republicans \\n\\n\\\\-67 Democrats \\n\\nHowever, Democrats dominate the Mayoral offices in Texas and city councils. \\n\\nIn 2018, Beto O'Rourke was just 214,922 (2.6%) votes away from unseating Ted Cruz \\n\\nUnfortunately in the recent election, Mj Hegar was 1,094,220 votes away from unseating John Cornyn. \\n\\nIn the 2020 exit polls; \\n\\n59% of Texans viewed climate change as a threat \\n\\nTrump only won Texan veterans by 4%  \\n\\nBiden won the black vote by 81%, the Latino vote by 17%, and the Asian vote by 33%\\n\\nBiden won the moderate vote by 34%\\n\\nBiden won the independent vote by 6%\\n\\nBiden won voters aged 18-24 by 20%, voters aged 25-29 by 13% and voters aged 30-39 by 3% \\n\\n48% of Texans think abortion should be legal compared to the 45% who want it banned. (This is big since Texas is extremely Conservative with a large Christian population) \\n\\nTrump only won voters who made $100k+ by 6%\\n\\n51% of Texans don't think Trump is fit enough to be President compared to the 47% that do \\n\\n49% of Texans view Trump as \\\"unfavorable\\\" compared to the 48% who view him as \\\"favorable\\\" \\n\\n56% of Texans approve of Trump compared to 42% who dissaprove of Trump \\n\\nBiden won amongst voters making $200k+ by 8% \\n\\n40% of Texans have the economy as their priority with racial inequality, COVID, and healthcare trailing as crime and safety finishes last (This is also huge since crime and safety tends to be a huge priority for Conservatives) \\n\\nTexans are split on whether to prioritize the economy or COVID (47%-47%) \\n\\n60% of Texans think racism is an important issue \\n\\nBiden was the first Democrat to win Tarrant County since 1964 \\n\\nTrump only won Dan Crenshaw's Gerrymandered District (TX-2) by 1% \\n\\nBiden won all the cities by a minimum of 14% \\n\\n11,317,911 out of 17,000,000 Texans voted in the 2020 Presidential Election \\n\\nWe're nearly there guys but how can we win?

Long answer:\\n**To my fellow Conservatives and to the lurking Dems thinking that these tariffs make the consumer pay more, buy less, hurt the economy, and drag down the stock market, you're 100% correct.**\\n\\nBut as I see it, there are two potential positive outcomes: either the tariffs are temporary and are being used as leverage to bring countries and/or companies that refuse to negotiate in good faith to the table (meaning the tariffs are eventually lifted), or they\\u2019re here to stay, in which case the resulting \\\"tax\\\" burden must be offset with other incentives that put or keep more money in people\\u2019s pockets. Otherwise, it will be a colossal failure that hurts the country and the Republicans in the long run.\\n\\nYesterday was Day 1 of the broad tariffs. Today is Day 2. Trump either cooks or gets cooked. Time will tell.\\n\\n**And if you're thinking, \\\"Time will tell\\\" playing with people\\u2019s retirement funds and incomes is no way to run a country, lol. People don\\u2019t have \\u201ctime\\u201d to just wait it out.**\\n\\nThe story of the country known as the USA already has a written ending, a bad one. The national debt will break this country sooner or later. Both Republicans and Democrats have made promises and done things \\\"for the people\\\". Some periods have been better than others, but the fundamental problem continues to grow.  The country itself is the one running out of time. We're speeding towards a wall, regardless of how \\u201cgood\\u201d  the president in office may \\\"drive\\\" towards it.\\n\\nI understand the worries, complaints, and pain this might cause. I'm not saying it's not real. But the same old, tested methods won\\u2019t change our course. The USA needs a different path. Otherwise, we\\u2019re just making the \\u201cbelly of the beast\\u201d more comfortable while we wait for the very predictable outcome.\\n\\nMost people think and act based on short-term gratification, I get that. I even understand it. But we need a different solution. So I think it's worth giving the elected president a shot at trying to fix things. It might not work out as he intends, but as the elected and sitting president, he\\u2019s earned the right to do things differently.\\n\\nAnd hey, if it doesn\\u2019t work, the Democrats will win a bunch of future elections and fix everything, right?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.   \n",

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n&gt; A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n&gt; This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n&gt; When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n&gt; It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n&gt; Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n&gt; The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n&gt; Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n&gt; The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n&gt; It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n&gt; That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n&gt; About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n&gt; There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n&gt; The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n&gt; Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n&gt; The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n&gt; There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n&gt; For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.</td>\n",

Megathread: US Supreme Court Finds in Trump v. United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts\\nOn Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of \"dimming prospect of a pre-election trial\".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:\\n\\n>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\\n\\nYou can read [the full opinion for yourself at this link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf).\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Supreme Court rules Trump has some immunity in federal election interference case, further delaying trial](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rules-trump-may-immunity-federal-election-inter-rcna149135) | nbcnews.com\\n[Donald J.

                                    Megathread: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies at 87\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural, and feminist icon has died. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.\\nArchitect of the legal fight for women‚Äôs rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation‚Äôs highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died of metastatic pancreatic cancer at

Or at least break Republican dominance over Texas both at the state and federal level\\nWhether Democrats or Republicans won Texas, the state has remained one of the most culturally Conservative and economically Conservative states in American history \\n\\nRepublicans have dominated Texas ever since 1952, when Eisenhower won it twice in a row, even when it was considered a part of the solid South (the old Confederate states that voted Democrat). Since 1952, Texas has only voted for a Democrat four times: JFK 1960, LBJ 1964, Hubert Humphrey 1968, Jimmy Carter 1976. \\n\\nNo Democrat has represented Texas in the Senate since 1994 (Bob Krueger). \\n\\nFor so many decades, Texas has remained the crown jewel for Republicans. It is the California for the GOP. \\n\\nBut with a huge increase in Latin American immigration, Democratic immigration (from states like California and NY etc.), and a growing hostility towards social and economic Conservatism (both neoconservatism, paleoconservatism etc.), Texas has slowly become more liberal and it's now being contested as a swing state. \\n\\nEven a lot of native Texans are beginning to dislike the Republican party. Surburban voters are becoming more liberal and the cities in Texas are reliably Democratic strongholds (Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas) \\n\\nIn the House, 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats reprsent Texas \\n\\nRepublicans still control both the House and Senate in the Texas legislature \\n\\nSenate: \\n\\n\\-19 Republicans \\n\\n\\-12 Democrats \\n\\nHouse: \\n\\n\\-83 Republicans \\n\\n\\-67 Democrats \\n\\nHowever, Democrats dominate the Mayoral offices in Texas and city councils. \\n\\nIn 2018, Beto O'Rourke was just 214,922 (2.6%) votes away from unseating Ted Cruz \\n\\nUnfortunately in the recent election, Mj Hegar was 1,094,220 votes away from unseating John Cornyn. \\n\\nIn the 2020 exit polls; \\n\\n59% of Texans viewed climate change as a threat \\n\\nTrump only won Texan veterans by 4%  \\n\\nBiden won the black vote by 81%, the Latino vote by 17%, and the Asian vote by 33%\\n\\nBiden won the moderate vote by 34%\\n\\nBiden won the independent vote by 6%\\n\\nBiden won voters aged 18-24 by 20%, voters aged 25-29 by 13% and voters aged 30-39 by 3% \\n\\n48% of Texans think abortion should be legal compared to the 45% who want it banned. (This is big since Texas is extremely Conservative with a large Christian population) \\n\\nTrump only won voters who made $100k+ by 6%\\n\\n51% of Texans don't think Trump is fit enough to be President compared to the 47% that do \\n\\n49% of Texans view Trump as \"unfavorable\" compared to the 48% who view him as \"favorable\" \\n\\n56% of Texans approve of Trump compared to 42% who dissaprove of Trump \\n\\nBiden won amongst voters making $200k+ by 8% \\n\\n40% of Texans have the economy as their priority with racial inequality, COVID, and healthcare trailing as crime and safety finishes last (This is also huge since crime and safety tends to be a huge priority for Conservatives) \\n\\nTexans are split on whether to prioritize the economy or COVID (47%-47%) \\n\\n60% of Texans think racism is an important issue \\n\\nBiden was the first Democrat to win Tarrant County since 1964 \\n\\nTrump only won Dan Crenshaw's Gerrymandered District (TX-2) by 1% \\n\\nBiden won all the cities by a minimum of 14% \\n\\n11,317,911 out of 17,000,000 Texans voted in the 2020 Presidential Election \\n\\nWe're nearly there guys but how can we win? What should our strategy be? How can we push Demcorats over the edge and break the red wall in Texas? \\n\\nJust look at how the Republican vote margin is slowly decreasing \\n\\n|Election Year (+ for Republican in votes and percent) |Republican |Democrat |\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|2020 (+5.6%) +631,221|Trump (5,873,085) (52.07%) |Biden (5,235,216) (46.42%)|\\n|2016 (+8.98%) +807,179|Trump (4,685,047) (52.10%) |Hillary (3,877,868) (43.12%)|\\n|2012 (+15.79%) +1,261,719|Romney (4,569,843) (57.17%) |Obama (3,308,124) (41.38%)|\\n|2008 (+11.77%) +950,695|McCain (4,479,328) (55.45%) |Obama (3,528,633) (43.68%) |\\n|2004 (+30.87%) +1,694,213|Bush Jr (4,526,917) (61.09%) |Kerry (2,832,704) (38.22%) |\\n|2000 (+21.92%) +1,365,893|Bush Jr (3,799,639) (59.30%) |Gore (2,433,746) (37.98%)|\\n|1996 (+4.93%) +276,484|Dole (2,736,167) (48.76%) |Clinton (2,459,683) (43.83%)|\\n|1992 (+3.48%) +214,256|Bush Sr (2,496,071) (40.56%) |Clinton (2,281,815) (37.08%) |\\n|1988 (+12.6%) +684,081|Bush Sr (3,036,829) (55.95%) |Dukakis (2,352,748) (43.35%) |\\n|1984 (+27.5%) +1,484,152|Reagan (3,433,428) (63.61%) |Mondale (1,949,276) (36.11%)|\\n|1980 (+13.86%) +629,558|Reagan (2,510,705) (55.28%) |Carter (1,881,147) (41.42%) |\\n|1972 (+32.96%) +1,144,605|Nixon (2,298,896) (66.20%)  |McGovern (1,154,291) (33.24%) |   \n",

Megathread: Supreme Court Rules on Subpoenas for President Donald Trump‚Äôs Financial Records\\nToday, the Supreme Court issued decisions for two highly anticipated cases involving subpoenas seeking President Trump's tax returns.\\n\\nThe Chief Justice wrote for the Court in _Trump v Vance_, affirming the Second Circuit and rejecting the Government's position that, under Article II and the Supremacy Clause, the President was entitled to absolute immunity and a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoenas. The case now goes back to the district court, where the Second Circuit permitted the Government to make alternative arguments. The vote was 5 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), 2 in concurrence with the decision (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).\\n\\nThe Chief Justice also wrote for the Court in _Trump vs Mazars_, vacating the lower court ruling affirming the Congressional subpoena and implementing a balancing test for the district court to consider in deciding whether to grant a Congressional subpoena, including:\\n\\n(1) whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants subpoenaing the President and his papers (ie. whether there are other sources that Congress could obtain this information from);\\n\\n(2) whether the scope of the subpoena is sufficiently narrow so that it is no broader than necessary to support Congress' legislative objective;\\n\\n(3) what the nature is of evidence Congress is offered to establish that a subpoena is necessary to advance a valid legislative agenda; and\\n\\n(4) what burden is imposed on the President, particularly since the subpoena originates from a rival branch of government that could use such subpoenas for institutional advantage. \\n\\nThe vote was 7 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Supreme Court rules President Trump must turn over tax

United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts\\nOn Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of \"dimming prospect of a pre-election trial\".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:\\n\\n&gt;Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\\n\\nYou can read [the full opinion for yourself at this link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf).\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Supreme Court rules Trump has some immunity in federal election interference case, further delaying trial](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rules-trump-may-immunity-federal-election-inter-rcna149135) | nbcnews.com\\n[Donald J.

Or at least break Republican dominance over Texas both at the state and federal level\\nWhether Democrats or Republicans won Texas, the state has remained one of the most culturally Conservative and economically Conservative states in American history \\n\\nRepublicans have dominated Texas ever since 1952, when Eisenhower won it twice in a row, even when it was considered a part of the solid South (the old Confederate states that voted Democrat). Since 1952, Texas has only voted for a Democrat four times: JFK 1960, LBJ 1964, Hubert Humphrey 1968, Jimmy Carter 1976. \\n\\nNo Democrat has represented Texas in the Senate since 1994 (Bob Krueger). \\n\\nFor so many decades, Texas has remained the crown jewel for Republicans. It is the California for the GOP. \\n\\nBut with a huge increase in Latin American immigration, Democratic immigration (from states like California and NY etc.), and a growing hostility towards social and economic Conservatism (both neoconservatism, paleoconservatism etc.), Texas has slowly become more liberal and it's now being contested as a swing state. \\n\\nEven a lot of native Texans are beginning to dislike the Republican party. Surburban voters are becoming more liberal and the cities in Texas are reliably Democratic strongholds (Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas) \\n\\nIn the House, 23 Republicans and 13 Democrats reprsent Texas \\n\\nRepublicans still control both the House and Senate in the Texas legislature \\n\\nSenate: \\n\\n\\-19 Republicans \\n\\n\\-12 Democrats \\n\\nHouse: \\n\\n\\-83 Republicans \\n\\n\\-67 Democrats \\n\\nHowever, Democrats dominate the Mayoral offices in Texas and city councils. \\n\\nIn 2018, Beto O'Rourke was just 214,922 (2.6%) votes away from unseating Ted Cruz \\n\\nUnfortunately in the recent election, Mj Hegar was 1,094,220 votes away from unseating John Cornyn. \\n\\nIn the 2020 exit polls; \\n\\n59% of Texans viewed climate change as a threat \\n\\nTrump only won Texan veterans by 4%  \\n\\nBiden won the black vote by 81%, the Latino vote by 17%, and the Asian vote by 33%\\n\\nBiden won the moderate vote by 34%\\n\\nBiden won the independent vote by 6%\\n\\nBiden won voters aged 18-24 by 20%, voters aged 25-29 by 13% and voters aged 30-39 by 3% \\n\\n48% of Texans think abortion should be legal compared to the 45% who want it banned.

The case now goes back to the district court, where the Second Circuit permitted the Government to make alternative arguments. The vote was 5 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), 2 in concurrence with the decision (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).\\n\\nThe Chief Justice also wrote for the Court in _Trump vs Mazars_, vacating the lower court ruling affirming the Congressional subpoena and implementing a balancing test for the district court to consider in deciding whether to grant a Congressional subpoena, including:\\n\\n(1) whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants subpoenaing the President and his papers (ie. whether there are other sources that Congress could obtain this information from);\\n\\n(2) whether the scope of the subpoena is sufficiently narrow so that it is no broader than necessary to support Congress' legislative objective;\\n\\n(3) what the nature is of evidence Congress is offered to establish that a subpoena is necessary to advance a valid legislative agenda; and\\n\\n(4) what burden is imposed on the President, particularly since the subpoena originates from a rival branch of government that could use such subpoenas for institutional advantage. \\n\\nThe vote was 7 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[Supreme Court rules President Trump must turn over tax

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it\\u2019s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It\\u2019s carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone\\u2019s mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That\\u2019s how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients \\u2014 particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions \\u2014 develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won\\u2019t get as sick, but it\\u2019s still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it\\u2019s time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it\\u2019s still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn\\u2019t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there\\u2019s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous \\u2014 even if here\\u2019s a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection \\u2014 because of their age or chronic health conditions \\u2014 are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don\\u2019t understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It\\u2019s the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation \\u2014 special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It\\u2019s this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation\\u2019s health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of \\u201csurge\\u201d in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There\\u2019s widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you\\u2019ve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year\\u2019s influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can\\u2019t contain it and we don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019re really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don\\u2019t expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.\",\n          \"Megathread: Judge Rules White House Counsel Don McGahn Must Comply With House Subpoena\\nA federal judge on Monday ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must comply with a subpoena and testify to Congress, delivering a significant win to House Democrats amid their impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\\n\\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, means that McGahn is obligated to comply with a House Judiciary Committee subpoena from April seeking to compel his testimony.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Submissions that may interest you\\n\\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\\n---|----\\n[McGhan must testify before Congress - Federal Judge](https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782705643/federal-judge-rules-that-mcgahn-must-testify-delivering-blow-to-white-house?utm_campaign=npr&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_term=nprnews&utm_medium=social) | choice.npr.org\\n[Judge says ex-White House counsel McGahn must appear before Congress for testimony](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/judge-says-ex-white-house-counsel-mcgahn-must-appear-before-congress-for-testimony.html) | cnbc.com\\n[Federal Judge Rules That McGahn Must Testify, Delivering Blow To White House](https://www.wuky.org/post/federal-judge-rules-mcgahn-must-testify-delivering-blow-white-house/) | wuky.org\\n[Former White House counsel Donald McGahn must comply with House subpoena, court rules in case that could affect impeachment inquiry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2019/11/25/former-white-house-counsel-donald-mcgahn-must-comply-with-house-subpoena-court-rules-in-case-that-could-affect-impeachment-inquiry/?tidr=a_breakingnews&hpid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar) | washingtonpost.com\\n[Judge rules Don McGahn must comply with House impeachment subpoena](https://www.axios.com/don-mcgahn-house-subpoena-ruling-trump-impeachment-dba4db98-6d91-4861-a6bc-2f7c66ba5ee5.html) | axios.com\\n[Judge rules former WH counsel McGahn must testify under subpoena](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/471913-judge-rules-former-wh-counsel-mcgahn-must-testify-under-subpoena) | thehill.com\\n[Don McGahn must testify to congress](https://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/judge-to-rule-on-house-subpoena-of-former-white-house-counsel-don-mcgahn-74059845773) | msnbc.com\\n[Former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify before Congress, judge rules](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4295727002) | amp.usatoday.com\\n[Former White House lawyer Donald McGahn must testify before Congress, which could shape impeachment hearings](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/25/judge-former-white-house-counsel-don-mcgahn-must-testify-before-congress/4295727002/) | eu.usatoday.com\\n[McGahn must comply with House subpoena, judge rules](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcgahn-must-comply-with-house-subpoena-judge-rules-2019-11-25?mod=mw_latestnews) | marketwatch.com\\n[Federal judge says former White House counsel Don McGahn must speak to House](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/don-mcgahn-house-subpoena-impeachment/index.html) | cnn.com\\n[Federal judge: McGahn must comply with House subpoena](https://apnews.com/22261df99d7541e5a2a4000cd3d14719?utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter) | apnews.com\\n[Don McGahn: former White House counsel must testify, judge rules](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/nov/25/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-democrats-2020-election-latest-updates) | theguardian.com\\n[Federal judge orders Don McGahn to comply with House subpoena](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-25/federal-judge-orders-don-mcgahn-comply-with-house-subpoena) | latimes.com\\n[Judge Orders Former Trump White House Lawyer Don McGahn To Obey Congressional Subpoena](https://www.thedailybeast.com/judge-orders-former-trump-white-house-lawyer-don-mcgahn-to-obey-congressional-subpoena?source=articles&via=rss) | thedailybeast.com\\n[Judge: Trump Can\\u2019t Block McGahn From Complying With Congressional Subpoena](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/judges-order-don-mcgahn-comply-congressional-subpoena) | talkingpointsmemo.com\\n[Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn Must Comply With House Subpoena, Judge Rules](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-mcgahn-testimony-ruling-trump-mueller-ukraine_n_5ddbf046e4b0d50f3293d9d7) | huffpost.com\\n[Judge says Don McGahn must testify before Congress in ruling with major implications for Trump impeachment inquiry](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-judge-mcgahn-trump-impeachment-witnesses-20191125-seu67e4nsvft5pf3iryb7vle3m-story.html) | nydailynews.com\\n[Donald McGahn Must Testify to Congress, Judge Rules;

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n> Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n> There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.   \n",

What is a novel coronavirus?**\\n\\n&gt; A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it‚Äôs a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\\n\\n&gt; This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It‚Äôs carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone‚Äôs mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That‚Äôs how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \\n\\n&gt; When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \\n\\n&gt; It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients ‚Äî particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions ‚Äî develop a severe form of pneumonia.\\n\\n&gt; Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won‚Äôt get as sick, but it‚Äôs still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it‚Äôs time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \\n\\n&gt; The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it‚Äôs still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\\n\\n&gt; Yes. It doesn‚Äôt appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there‚Äôs no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \\n\\n&gt; The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous ‚Äî even if here‚Äôs a low percentage of people who die from them. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\\n\\n&gt; It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection ‚Äî because of their age or chronic health conditions ‚Äî are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \\n\\n&gt; That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don‚Äôt understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\\n\\n&gt; About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It‚Äôs the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation ‚Äî special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It‚Äôs this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation‚Äôs health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\\n \\n&gt; There‚Äôs widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you‚Äôve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year‚Äôs influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \\n\\n&gt; The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\\n  \\n&gt; Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\\n\\n&gt; The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\\n \\n&gt; There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don‚Äôt expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\\n\\n&gt; For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.</td>\n",

No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion.
